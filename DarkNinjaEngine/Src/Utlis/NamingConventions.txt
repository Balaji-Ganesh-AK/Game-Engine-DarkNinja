Use CamelCase for all names. Start types (such as classes, structs, and typedefs) with a capital letter, other names (functions, variables) with a lowercase letter. You may use an all-lowercase name with underscores if your class closely resembles an external construct (e.g., a standard library construct) named that way.
C++ interfaces are named with a Interface suffix, and abstract base classes with an Abstract prefix.
Member variables are named with a trailing underscore.
Accessors for a variable foo_ are named foo() and setFoo().
Global variables are named with a g_ prefix.
Static class variables are named with a s_ prefix.
Global constants are often named with a c_ prefix.
