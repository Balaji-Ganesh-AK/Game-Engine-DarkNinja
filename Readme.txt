Hi Joe,

Due to personal reasons I had to travel back to India, there is a bug in my collect function, and I couldn't fix it because of the time constrain. Other things work properly. 
In my heapManager class, I have used inline-block descriptions, which can be found in the memory manager file. I have used _BitScanForward() to find the first set and clear bit in my IBitArray class.
